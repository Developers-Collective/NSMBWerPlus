# NSMBWer+
### Introduction

This fork of the NSMBWer repo is a heavily modified version that aims to keep it up to date with current NSMBW modding while keeping everything from Vanilla intact.
Most notably, this version uses Abood's more sprites mod to implement every custom sprite and actor from Newer while keeping the ones they replaced.
NSMBWer+ is unfinished, please submit any issues or bugs to the issues page.

### Licensing

Like in the original repo, the source code and tools are released under the MIT license.
See the `LICENSE` file in this repository for full details.

### Requirements

#### For compiling NSMBWer+:

- Windows or OS that runs [Wine]
- [devkitPPC][dkp]
- Python 3.x
- Python libraries: PyYAML, pyelftools
- NXP ['CodeWarrior Special Edition'][cw] for MPC55xx/MPC56xx v2.10
  - If this direct link doesn't work, the original page is
    [available on the Internet Archive][cwIA].
  - The installer does not work with Wine; you may use `extractCW.sh`
    from the root of the repo in the same directory as the installer to
    extract the necessary files instead (requires cabextract).
  - You only need the Command Line Tools component in the custom
    install configuration.
  - After installing it, you need `license.dat` from the installation root,
    and the DLL and EXE files inside `PowerPC_EABI_Tools/Command_Line_Tools`.

Full setup instructions are included at the bottom of this readme.

### What's Here

#### NSMBWer+
A build is inside this folder, including all necessary game files, an XML and the related folders. If you
want to create a mod, starting with this is suggested. Keep in mind this build doesn't include the
custom music or tilesets from Newer, but they can be added.

It also includes an edited 01-01, 01-06, 06-01, and 06-02 that removes old unused sprite settings from Nintendo set
on several sprites that, now would crash NSMBWer+. They are different flags for sprite recolors
that don't exist in base Newer.

#### Kamek

All the NSMBWer+ hacks are inside the Kamek folder in this repository but, technically, Kamek is
really just a simple build system for calling the tools to compile/assemble
each source file and putting together an output file you can inject into your
game.

Unlike most typical build systems, though, there's a bunch of features
specific to game hacks like NSMBWer+:

- Kamek is configured through a game-specific project file; each project
  pulls in various modules, which can each contain C++ and assembly source
  files, and hooks
- Hooks are different types of patches that are used to inject things into the
  game: patch static code/data in RAM, overwrite pointers with a reference to
  a symbol exported from Kamek code, inject branch instructions, ...
- Memory addresses in the linker script and used by hooks are automatically
  converted to match all supported game versions - Kamek uses the original
  version of the PAL/European NSMBW release as a reference.
- The compiled output is converted to a specific format expected by the
  NSMBWer+ loader.

#### NSMBWer+ Hacks

All of the code for NSMBWer+ is included here. For the most part, it is just
Newer's code but with Koopatlas stripped from it, which did require many changes
for some of Newer's features to work. (Mostly Newer sprites replacing worldmap actors)

#### Loader

This is the in-game half of Kamek - it's a simple loader that links the
custom code generated by Kamek into the game after the rels.

This needs to be compiled using ['Sparkamek'][sparkamek], and is remade to load
earlier than the Newer loader. Thankfully, since it works perfectly fine, 
and now supports every variation of NSMBW that was released for the Wii,
there's not too much of a reason to deal with this. It's mostly here
on the offchance something needs to be changed.

## Installation

### Setup

- First install Python 3. If on Windows, ensure it is added to PATH
  upon installation. Next, run:

  - On Windows:
    `py -3 -m pip install pyyaml pyelftools`

  - On other OSs:
    `python3 -m pip install pyyaml pyelftools`

- Install DevkitPro's devkitPPC. Their official instructions for
  this are found [here][dkp].

- The last dependency is NXP ['CodeWarrior Special Edition'][cw]
  for MPC55xx/MPC56xx v2.10. You will also need [Wine] if you
  are running an OS other than Windows.

  - NOTE: the installer is known to fail with Wine.
    You may extract the files from it with ``extractCW.sh``
    on the root of the repo (which requires cabextract,
    available from most package managers).

  - CodeWarrior's tools are by default installed to:
  
  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Freescale\CW for MPC55xx and MPC56xx 2.10\PowerPC_EABI_Tools\Command_Line_Tools`

  - Copy the files inside to `Kamek/tools/cw` - Kamek assumes they
    are there.

  - Also, on Windows, make sure the following system variable is added
    to your environment variables, with the name `LM_LICENSE_FILE`:

  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Freescale\CW for MPC55xx and MPC56xx 2.10\license.dat`

  - The ``license.dat`` file may alernatively be copied to
    `Kamek/tools/cw` if you are using Wine.

### Usage

There is a script in the Kamek folder that invokes `makeGame.py`,
named makeNSMBWer.

On Windows, run the batch versions - you can just double-click them.

On macOS, Linux, or other Unix-like systems, use the bash versions.
Open a terminal in the same directory and run it like:

`./makeNSMBWer`

The resulting output is placed in a folder called `Build_NSMBWerProject`
(where X is the name of the Kamek project). These files go in
`/NewerRes` on the game disc (this folder is included in the Riivolution patch).

## Changes:
* Code structure has been updated to match that of Newer 1.30.
* Changes that break vanilla levels (such as the newer chest mod) have been re-implemented. Check the vanilla branch if you'd like to have these changes removed for your mod.
* All Newer level sprites are present here, along with the ones they replace.
* 2-Castle hardcode fixes from AnotherSMBW.
* Added more effects to effect spawner.
* Support for Yoshi Drums in music slots 200+.
* Load custom music from the default BRSTM folder.
* Ported fixes from RoadrunnerWMC's NSMBW-Updated project.

#### Upcoming Changes/Fixes
* Piranhatlas support(?)
* Add Hammer Suit rendering on the worldmap
